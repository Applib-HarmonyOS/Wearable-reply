# Wearable Reply

While Google made a very nice wearable activity to reply to notifications, they didn't make a good `Intent` to compose text within apps running Android Wear 2.0. This library aims to simplify allowing text input in your app, via voice, keyboard, or canned responses. Google really should have provided something like this from the start, and not juse kept it for notifications.

## Including It In Your Project

To include it in your project, add this to your module's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
	...
	compile 'com.klinkerapps:wearable-reply:1.0.01
}
```

Usage is really simple. Start the reply activity with:

```java
WearableReplyActivity.start(activity);
WearableReplyActivity.start(activity, R.array.reply_options);
WearableReplyActivity.start(activity, new String[] {"test 1", "test 2" });
```

If you omit the `String[]` or the array resource, the `WearableReplyActivity` will display the default canned responses: "Yes", "No", "Maybe", "Ok", and "Thanks".

When the user has done the text input, the results will be delivered to your `Activity#onActivityResult` method, and can be pulled with:

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    String result = WearableReplyActivity.getResultText(data);
    if (result != null) {
        Toast.makeText(this, result, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
    }
}
```
